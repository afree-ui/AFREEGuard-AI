# 🤖 AFREEGuard-AI  
**Safe AI Guardrails with On-Chain Policy Governance (Algorand-powered)**  

---

## 🌍 Vision  
AI is shaping the future, but **safety, accountability, and trust** are missing.  
AFREEGuard-AI bridges **AI safety + blockchain accountability**, ensuring that AI systems operate with **transparency, fairness, and compliance** — all governed on-chain.  

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building  
- 🛡️ **AI Guardrails** – Secure, explainable, and bias-checked AI models  
- 🔗 **Algorand-powered Governance** – DAO-style decision making with transparency  
- 💰 **Tokenized Incentives** – Encourage responsible data sharing & model contributions  
- 📊 **User Dashboard** – Simple, human-friendly AI governance interface  

---

## 🎯 Problem We Solve  
1. **Data Privacy** → Preserving sensitive information with on-chain proofs  
2. **Incentivization** → Token rewards for ethical participation and contributions  
3. **Verification** → Ensuring only trusted actors and data enter the ecosystem  
4. **Usability** → An accessible dashboard for compliance teams, startups, and Web3 orgs
